As far as a single incident like United/Dao goes, Yes, that is the fault of the individuals, companies, and other entities involved.  There's no excuse for treating someone like that.\n\nHowever, if customers are concerned about the airlines' treatment of passengers as a whole, look in the mirror.  Passengers get bumped from their flights tens of thousands of times every year, and it's approved by law.  Nobody complains that that is legal until they get hurt by it or there is a public incident like United/Dao, because deep down, people would rather save $10 on a flight.  These laws are there because people told their congressmen they wanted them there.\n\nThe airline industry is cutthroat and profit margins are razor-thin.  In addition, it's a business model that is easily upset.  One day of bad thunderstorms at a hub can wreck the whole quarter or even more.  As an illustration of this, IATA recently published a glowing report praising record profits for the airline industry and an unprecedented industry profit for the third year in a row.  However, if you read into the meat of the report, you'll read that by \"record profits\" IATA means that the airline industry made about what an average business makes, which is extremely rare.\n\nIf people don't want to get treated like cattle and bumped off their flights... sorry, folks, but goodbye affordable airfare.

Second, the airline industry is far from a free market race to the bottom. That just doesn't happen without GOVERNMENT occlusion. No more than 25% of American Airlines can be owned by foreign investors. That right there is why Virgin Atlantic was bought by Alaska despite Richard Branson not wanting it so. He wanted to compete. Localities make contracts with certain airlines to operate in their airports, which is why many airlines don't fly certain places. It's not a free market. Problems like this are never a free market. They are government constraints that limit the free market without the added benefit of subsidies that you find in other countries. Lufthansa, British airways, Air France are all subsidized directly. This is the United States indirectly subsidizing airlines by limiting competition. Races to the bottom don't happen in a true free market. So we can either try to further deregulate, or we can directly subsidize like the rest of the world. But Americans like to have a boogie man. That boogie man of late has been big business... And of course the only solution is to give its creator more authority.... It's genius. \n\nPlease do not confuse this with safety protocols and faa regulations. This is much more macro economic theory. Have a set standard for safe flying in place and allow a market to compete freely within those boundaries. That's all that is needed. And that's not what we have.\ufeff", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Jc Me"}
